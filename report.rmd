## Data Summary

```{r load-data}
df <- read_csv("Data/viewership.csv")
glimpse(df)
summary(df$Viewers)
```

## Viewership Over Seasons

```{r plot-viewers}
ggplot(df, aes(x = Season, y = Viewers)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Average Viewers by Season",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Viewers (millions)"
  )
```

## Season-to-Season Changes

```{r plot-changes}
df <- df %>%
  arrange(Season) %>%
  mutate(Change = Viewers - lag(Viewers))

ggplot(df, aes(x = Season, y = Change)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    title = "Change in Viewers Between Seasons",
    x = "Season",
    y = "Δ Viewers (millions)"
  )
```

## Observations

Between Season 1 and Season 2 viewership **increased** by `r round(df$Change[df$Season == 2], 1)` million.  
Between Season 6 and Season 7 it **decreased** by `r abs(round(df$Change[df$Season == 7], 1))` million.
